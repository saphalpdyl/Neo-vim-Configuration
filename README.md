# nvim configuration in lua
Configuration files for my neovim setup in lua.

Neovim version : 0.10.0

## Important steps / bugs
- Be sure to install packer first
- Clipboard.vim may cause slow startup times ( FIXED NOW by installing xsel )
- Telescope has a bug on version==<0.1.3 and 0.1.5 ( FIXED NOW by using version 0.1.4 )
